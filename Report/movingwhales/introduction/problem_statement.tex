\section{Problem Statement}
We want people to be able to listen to music together even though they are not
necessarily in the same room without having to resort to piracy to do it.

Today, a lot of people will illegally download music that they have been
recommended, because they want to listen to it before they spend money
on the song, and after it has been downloaded, people may keep it without
later paying for the song.

Another problem is that if you want to discuss a specific point in a song,
you have to find and share timestamps, and again make sure the other person
or persons have access to the song.

We will solve these problems by developing a web-service which offers
solutions, in form of a synchronized listening without a need to download
any application or music file.
