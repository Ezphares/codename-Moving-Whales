\section{Problem formulation}
When developing a system at a large scale like a social music management system it is possible to do it one man. At the same time when in a group it is more efficient to split the problem into smaller sub problems and assign a sub problem to each group member. There may arise several different problems when developing such a system, like how to make a system that is a music management system but at the same time it has to be a social networking system. The problem may be divided into two large problems, a management part and a social part. And then those parts can then be further divided into smaller problems and at the end it all gets combined.
