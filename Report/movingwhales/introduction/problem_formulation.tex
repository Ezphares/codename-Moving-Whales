\section{Problem formulation}
When developing a system at a large scale like a social music management system, one opportunity is to do it one man. But when you are in a group it is more efficient to split the problem into smaller sub problems and assign a sub problem to each group member. There may arise several different problems when developing such a system, like how to make a system that is a music management system but at the same time it has to be a social networking system. The problem may be divided into two large problems, a management part and a social part. And then those parts can then be further divided into smaller problems and at the end it all gets combined. Also when making such a system you always have to keep in mind that you are developing for other people, also referred to as users. So in that way you always have to think of making the system as user friendly as possible. To achieve that one has go through some tests with the users involved.
