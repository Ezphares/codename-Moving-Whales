\subsection{Tornado}
Using Tornado as our webserver was great, seeing as it was quick and easy for development. Performancewise it could have been
better, but for the rapid prototyping done in this project, it was very well suited. Some of the stability issues might be due
to Tornado's implementation of WebSocket, but we did not have time to investigate this further. The documentation for Tornado
is not very good. It lacks examples and it is hard to find what you are looking for within it, however the source code available
online, linked from the documentation, is very well commented and it is easy to get information from.
The group will definitely consider using Tornado for other projects requiring rapid prototyping.
