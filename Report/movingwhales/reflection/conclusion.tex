\section{Conclusion}
In the analysis we analysed different methods and technologies fore different fields of our project fore example programming languages etc. After analysing different methods and technologies and comparing them to each other we found out which technologies, framework, programming languages and development methods we wanted to use. We then used those technologies and methods for developing our system.

We designed a system that would meet our requirements and it contains management for music and a social part, even though it might be in a simple stage and still have a few bugs. Due to the focus on programming for users in this project, we have worked with some users in testing the system to get a result of how they experience the system. It resulted in a few bug findings and some users friendliness difficulties.

We implemented drag and drop function for uploading music, to make i more fancy and stylish and to accompany the social part we implemented websocket.   
 
We ended up with a system that handles the management of music and that gives the opportunity to be social by joining sessions.
