\section{Conclusion}
The system developed allows a user to upload music to his or her library, listen to it and organize it. It lets the user join
in sessions with other people and synchronizes the music playing, which enables people to listen to music together without
illegally downloading it. The synchronization makes it easy for people to share specific parts of the song, simply by
skipping in the song. 

We reached the goal of the problem statement by analyzing the problem and formulating specific requirements for a solution. We
also decided upon an agile method of development, the so-called Scrum, and the tools needed to complete the tasks, i.e. a
framework, Django, a server, Tornado, a WebSocket connection and a means of distribution: the Internet. The design of the
interface was evaluated with heuristic evaluation and the system was tested by three people in a co-operative evaluation.
