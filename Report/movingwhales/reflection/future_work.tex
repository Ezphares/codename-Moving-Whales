\section{Future work}
Our system solves the basic functionalities, managing music and being social, and most of our other requirements. But even though it solves most of our requirements it does not mean that there cannot be worked further on the system. For instance, there are bugs that have been found during testing with users that can be fixed to eventually make it more user friendly.

A feature that is most likely to be considered implemented in the future is OAuth, if of course worked further on the system. It would be a major improvement on the social side of the system if OAuth got implemented, then people would be able to connect to Movingwhales trough their Facebook, Twitter or MySpace accounts etc. Status updates would be a great social implementation in the future, and such as pictures and more information about one self would also be a great feature for socialising.  

More feature for helping the user through the system when used first couple of times would be an improvement on the user friendliness part. It could be features like more text explaining or even better some animated usage instructions.

Making a rating system for the music in the future would also be great, such that people can rate their own and others music. And then combine the rating with a music discovery system, where it can discover music that you might like. By watching at the music that you have rated the most and then find music for you that is of the same genre.

And then there is of course a feature where playing rights can be implemented. Such that those starting sessions can control whom in the session has which rights with controlling the songs.

\textbf{List of issues:}
\begin{itemize}
\item When login in you have to press on the login button, you cannot just press enter. Generally you have to press every button with the mouse, enter has not been implemented. That is an issue that has to be fixed to make it easier for the user.
\item The helping text around the system is not so much of a help, users mostly skip reading it. So maybe another solution for help instruction would be more of a help, for example animated help.
\item Other audio files than mp3 can be uploaded but they cannot be played, that is an issues that also would have to be fixed.
\item Then there are some buttons missing, like a button for uploading files for those not comfortable with drag and drop and a button for inviting people to session.
\end{itemize}
