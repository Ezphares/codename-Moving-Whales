\section{Future work}
Our system solves the basic functionalities, managing music and being social, and most of our other requirements. But even though it solves most of our requirements it does not mean that there cannot be worked further on the system. For instance, there are bugs that have been found during testing with users that can be fixed to eventually make it more user friendly.

A feature that is most likely to be considered implemented in the future is OAuth, if of course worked further on the system. It would be a major improvement on the social side of the system if OAuth got implemented, then people would be able to connect to Movingwhales trough their Facebook, Twitter or MySpace accounts etc. Status updates would be a great social implementation in the future, and such as pictures and more information about one self would also be a great feature for socialising.  

More feature for helping the user through the system when used first couple of times would be an improvement on the user friendliness part. It could be features like more text explaining or even better some animated usage instructions.

Making a rating system for the music in the future would also be great, such that people can rate their own and others music. And then combine the rating with a music discovery system, where it can discover music that you might like. By watching at the music that you have rated the most and then find music for you that is of the same genre.

And then there is of course a feature where playing rights can be implemented. Such that those starting sessions can control whom in the session has which rights with controlling the songs.
