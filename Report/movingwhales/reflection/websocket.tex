\subsection{WebSocket}
Having used WebSocket in an earlier project, some of the group members knew how to use and implement it already, however
WebSocket is still very much a work in progress, with a very poor documentation - only a draft exists. Changes to the protocol
are likely to happen without notice, which means that the code will have to be revised. Coupled with the aforementioned poor
documentation it is quite hard to implement a working WebSocket, but it is the only option available for having a constant, bidirectional
connection, which is vital to the synchronized playing that was one of our goals. Various browsers also implement different versions
of the WebSocket standard, which means that you can only develop for one browser at a time. 

The above problems are however quite fair, considering the fact that this is not a standard yet, and that the current versions are suggestions, not finished implementations. The WebSocket, once it is a finished standard will be an amazing tool.
