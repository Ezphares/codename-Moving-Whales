\subsection{System requirements}

This subsection will via a use-case diagram describe what functionality a 
user has access to in the Moving Whales program. It is important to note that 
given that a use-case diagram is an early stage diagram meant to convey the 
ideas behind the program and user functionality, it may not be totally 
accurate with the final product as given in this report.
