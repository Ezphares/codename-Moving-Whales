\subsection{Long-polling}


Long-polling functions much like the same way polling does. The intention is that, via long-polling, the browser creates a connection with the server - and the server then keeps this connection running with the client for a longer duration\cite{lubbersgreco}. Unlike polling, requests are not sent repeatedly to keep a connection running\cite{lubbersgreco}. The connection terminates if the server does not respond the poll within the time-interval. After that, it resumes again with a new long-lasting poll\cite{lubbersgreco}. If the server has a high message volume, long-polling does not differ much from traditional polling since each notification of new data returned to the client would terminate the connection - only to restart the procedure\cite{lubbersgreco}.
