\subsection{Long-polling}

Long-polling functions much like the way polling does. The intention is 
that, via long-polling, the browser creates a connection with the server 
and the server then keeps this connection running with the client for a 
longer duration. Unlike polling, requests are not sent 
repeatedly. The connection 
terminates if the server does not respond within the time-interval. 
After that, it resumes with a new long-lasting poll. 
If the server has a high message volume, long-polling does not differ much 
from traditional polling since each notification of new data returned to the 
client would terminate the connection - only to restart the 
procedure.\cite{lubbersgreco}
