\subsubsection{Implementation and Unit Testing}


The software design documents help split the work into units which are developed and tested for their function. This is the phase were actual programming begins - but the actual product that is being produced here, are just small units of verified and functioning code\cite{waterfallexplained}. The results of this phase (units of functioning program) are used in the next phase\cite{waterfallexplained}.
