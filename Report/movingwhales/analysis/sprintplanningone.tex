\subsubsection{Part one: What will be done?}


In the first part of the meeting the Development Team tries to shed some light on what functionalities of the program they think reachable during the sprint\cite{scrumguide11}. In collaboration with the Product Owner's Product Backlog and past increments, the Development Team tries to construct a number of features and functionalities they think can be accomplished during the sprint. Only the Development Team may decide what features can be implemented. The goal of the first part of the meeting is a Sprint Goal\cite{scrumguide11}.
