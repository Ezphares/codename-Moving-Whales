\subsection{The Scrum Team}


The Scrum Team consists of three key roles. These roles are: the Product Owner, the 
Development Team, and lastly the Scrum master\cite{scrumguide11}. The idea behind Scrum is 
to keep the Scrum Teams self-organizing and cross-functional. A Self-organizing team is not 
affected by outsiders not part of the Scrum Team\cite{scrumguide11}. The self-organizing 
Scrum Teams can decide themselves how to do their work best and most 
efficiently\cite{scrumguide11}. Cross-functional teams have the competency they need to not 
run into obstacles in which they need outside help\cite{scrumguide11}.


The purpose of a Scrum Team is to work iteratively\cite{scrumguide11}. By working
iteratively they optimize feedback opportunities\cite{scrumguide11}. After each iteration,
if the Scrum Team delivers parts of the product that is labeled 'Done' it should be
potentially working parts of the product\cite{scrumguide11}. This way Scrum tries to ensure
that there will always be working parts of the product out\cite{scrumguide11}.
