\section{WebSocket}

WebSockets are a new technology meant to make it easier for developers to keep their web applications updated in real-time\cite{andersen10}. A WebSocket is a full-duplex communication channel 
that operates via a socket. A WebSocket combines the 
standard HTTP-connection with more efficient means of transferring data and 
text\cite{lubbersgreco}.


WebSockets are very efficient as they decrease the latency during a message 
transfer significantly. When a browser visits a page it 
sends a HTTP request to the web server. For data that is very sensitive to quick updates 
(a stock exchange for example) the data which the server sends could wind up 
being old and no longer relevant either because the user simply walks away 
from the computer for a set duration or the website's data is being constantly 
updated. The user would have to keep hitting the browser's 
refresh button to make sure that the data that is received is the newest data 
- obviously this is not a very clever solution. WebSockets 
help alleviate this problem\cite{lubbersgreco}.


There are a number of other solutions that try to solve the same issues as the 
WebSocket - but bear in mind that these solutions are
among the first solutions to solve the problem of updating real-time 
data\cite{lubbersgreco}. These can be a study in their own and 
will therefore not be described extensively in this report-segment. Examples 
of the solutions are polling, long-polling and streaming.
