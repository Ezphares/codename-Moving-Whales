\subsubsection{Inspection}

Inspectors inspect artifacts to ensure that things go as intended and that the product goal 
is reached without any undesired surprises\cite{scrumguide11}. It is important that 
inspections are never so frequent that they cause annoyance and become a hindrance to the
work output\cite{scrumguide11}. To ensure a good balance between frequent inspections and 
not getting in the way of work, inspections are the most beneficial when they are performed 
by skilled inspectors.
