\subsubsection{Inspection}


Inspectors inspect artifacts to ensure that there are no undesired variances toward reaching
the product goal\cite{scrumguide11}. It is important that inspections are never so frequent
that they get in the way of work\cite{scrumguide11}. To ensure a good balance between
frequent inspections and not getting in the way of work, inspections are the most beneficial
when they are performed by skilled inspectors\cite{scrumguide11}.
