\section{Scrum}

The following section will cover information about Scrum. Mainly, what are the 
processes, what are the user roles, and what should one keep in mind when 
trying to implement Scrum into their product? Scrum will be explained in some 
depth and then compared to the Waterfall method, which will be described in 
brief, to help determine which development method would be the correct option 
for this project.
