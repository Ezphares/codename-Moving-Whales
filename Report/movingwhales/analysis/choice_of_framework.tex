\section{Choice of framework}

Choice of framework for developing is largely a matter of preference. There 
are multiple frameworks available in various languages, such as 
Django\cite{djangoproject11}  for developing in Python, CakePHP\cite{cake11} 
for developing in PHP and Ruby on Rails\cite{ruby11} for development in Ruby. 
These are all MVC-based frameworks, and the choice of framework thus comes 
down to what the group decided was the most efficient.

CakePHP was one option, but there is no singular documentation for the 
framework\cite{hartjes09} which would slow the work down significantly, as no group member 
had previous experience with the framework. Seeing as a few of the group 
members had programming experience with Python, and the Django framework 
was very well documented,the group chose Django as the framework for 
developing this project.
