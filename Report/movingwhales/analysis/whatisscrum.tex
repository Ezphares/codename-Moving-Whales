\subsection{What is Scrum?}


Scrum is an iterative development method\cite{scrumguide11}.
Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed scrum as a framework for developing and sustaining complex products\cite{scrumguide11}. Scrum has been defined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, as follows:


\textbf{Scrum (n):} A framework within people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value\cite{scrumguide11}.
With this in mind, there are several key features that defines scrum\cite{scrumguide11}.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Lightweight
	\item Simple to understand
	\item Extremely difficult to master
\end{itemize}


The scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their roles, events, artifacts and rules\cite{scrumguide11}. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum's success and usage\cite{scrumguide11}. 
It is the rules of Scrum that binds together the events, roles and artifacts to govern the relationship / interaction between all of these components\cite{scrumguide11}. Scrum functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies and practices\cite{scrumguide11}.
