\subsubsection{The Scrum Master}

The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure that all parties participating in Scrum
understand it as well as use it.  There are rules, theory and practices
that the Scrum Master should follow and use to bring everyone to a point of common
understanding\cite{scrumguide11}. The Scrum Master is not supposed to lead
the team as a whole, but to solve problems that the team members may encounter so that the
sprints can be completed on time. The Scrum Master helps the entirety of
the team, meaning both the Product Owner and Development Team\cite{scrumguide11}. In some
situations the Scrum Master may also help the organization behind the Product
Owner if one exists. The Scrum Master is typically viewed as a
coach\cite{scrumguide11}.
