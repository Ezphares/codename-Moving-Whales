\subsubsection{The Scrum Master}


The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure that all parties participating in Scrum
understand it as well as use it\cite{scrumguide11}.  There are rules, theory and practices
that the Scrum Master should follow and use to bring everyone to a point of common
understanding when using Scrum\cite{scrumguide11}. The Scrum Master is not supposed to lead
the team as a whole, but to solve problems that the team members may encounter so that the
sprints can be completed on time\cite{scrumguide11}. The Scrum Master helps the entirety of
the team, meaning both the Product Owner and Development Team\cite{scrumguide11}. In some
situations the Scrum Master may also help the organization behind the Product Owner (if
there is one). The Scrum Master is typically viewed as a coach\cite{scrumguide11}.
