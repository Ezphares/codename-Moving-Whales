\subsubsection{Part two: How will it be done?}

The second part of the meeting is typically more technical and concrete. It is here the 
Development Team tries to figure out how to convert the requirements in the Product Backlog 
and the agreed functionalities they need to try and implement can actually be 
done\cite{scrumguide11}. 


The goal is to create a 'done' increment and have enough work during this sprint, that it 
will not be accomplished before the sprint's end\cite{scrumguide11}. On the other hand, if 
the Development Team feels that there is too much work to handle during the sprint, it can 
renegotiate the Sprint Goal to be more fitting\cite{scrumguide11}.


At the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Development Team should be able to tell the 
Scrum Master and Product Owner how they intend to reach their Sprint Goal.
