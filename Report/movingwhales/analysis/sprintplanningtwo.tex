\subsubsection{Part two: How will we do?}

The second part of the meeting is typically more technical and concrete. Here
the Development Team tries to figure out how to fulfill the requirements in the
Product Backlog\cite{scrumguide11}. 


The goal is to match the workload to the length of the sprint\cite{scrumguide11}.
 If the Development Team feels that there is too much work to 
 handle during the sprint, they can renegotiate the Sprint Goal to be more 
 fitting\cite{scrumguide11}.


At the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Development Team should be able to tell the 
Scrum Master and Product Owner how they intend to reach their Sprint Goal.
