\subsection{Nonfunctional requirements prioritized}


The non-functional requirements of the program will be rated on a four-step scale from very important, important, less important to not important.
\\
Following every non-functional requirement and its rating, will be a short description of what the non-functional requirement covers, as well as a justification behind the rating given.
\newpage

\noindent
Usability - \textbf{Important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{Ease of use and learnability.}

\vspace{5 mm}

\noindent
It is in the nature of the program to be easy to use. A social, online music management program should be easy for its users to understand and make use of, to ensure they see the idea behind it, and keep using it frequently. Usability does not receive top rating however, given that the project's main focus was music management.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Availability - \textbf{Very important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
It is very important that a user has access to their online music library at all times. The project's main focus was music management. In the event that the user experiences downtime, they would not have access to any sort of music management, or indeed their entire music library. Uptime is therefore a very important requirement.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Effectiveness - \textbf{Less important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The amount of computing resources and code required by a program to perform a function.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Effectiveness is not trivially solved, but it is not a priority that should take precedence over availability or usability for that matter. It is not important for this project to have fast code-execution to make it perform as intended.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Correctness - \textbf{Very important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The degree of which a program satisfies its requirement specification.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Correctness is very important given the nature of a university project. 

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Security - \textbf{Important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The extent of which the program is secure from misuse by unauthorized users.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
The program is a web based application, for that reason it is important to have some security. It is not rated very important however because the service does not store person-critical information.
\newpage
Scalability - \textbf{Less important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The ability of which a system may gracefully adapt to a growing amount of work.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Though it is part of the program's needed requirements to sustain multiple users in music sessions. Much of the scalability for program will be geared toward better hardware. Scalability is not part of music management either - therefore it is rated as less important.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Reusability - \textbf{Less important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{The degree of which the program can be used in other applications.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Developers should not go out of their way to fulfil the reusability aspect of the program. It is considered good conduct if reusability is kept in mind when more 'general' aspects of the program are coded and it can be implemented without much extra work but it is far from an integral part of the system design.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Interoperability - \textbf{Not important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{Effort required to couple one system with another.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Interoperability is not important for this program because websockets are not fully standardized between browsers. While websockets are still in development the group decided to keep it simple and only focus on a chrome-based release. For future work, interoperability would be prioritized much higher.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Testability - \textbf{Important}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
\textit{Effort required to test a program to ensure it performs as intended.}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
The program is created using the agile development method SCRUM. For this reason testability has to be rated important, to ensure that developers keep in mind to write the code in a way it is easy to test the correctness of the program as more features are added.
