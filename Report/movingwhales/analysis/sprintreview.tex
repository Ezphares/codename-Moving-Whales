\subsubsection{The Sprint Review}


The Sprint Review is a meeting held at the end of a sprint. The meeting is time boxed for 4 hours (less if the sprint is smaller), and is being held to inspire feedback by the entire Scrum Team (Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner and other stakeholders)\cite{scrumguide11}. The meeting is expected to shed light on what is considered finished product, and what is not\cite{scrumguide11}. The entire team then collaborates on figuring out what could be worked on for the next sprint\cite{scrumguide11}. 


Aside from discussing what was finished and what was not, the Development Team should also shed light on what went well during the sprint, and what did not go well\cite{scrumguide11}. What problems the Development Team ran into should be addressed as well - and in particular, how these problems were solved\cite{scrumguide11}. The Development Team is expected to answer question to the rest of the Scrum Team - if any - regarding the product that was worked on during the sprint\cite{scrumguide11}. The result of the Sprint Review meeting should be a revised Product Backlog to form a foundation for the next Sprint Planning Meeting\cite{scrumguide11}.
