\subsubsection{Sprint Planning Meeting}

The work of a sprint is determined at the Sprint Planning Meeting. The entire Scrum Team is 
gathered at this meeting and the meeting is time boxed to eight hours for a one
month sprint. If a sprint is shorter than one month, the meeting does not have
to take eight hours\cite{scrumguide11}. 


The actual time box of this meeting can then decrease proportionally with the amount of time 
scheduled for a sprint. For example, if a sprint takes two weeks instead of four
weeks, the meeting should take four, instead of eight
hours\cite{scrumguide11}.  The Sprint Planning Meeting consists of two parts each time boxed to last half of the total time boxed duration 
for the Sprint Planning Meeting. In the event of an eight hour meeting, each
part would take four hours\cite{scrumguide11}.


The Sprint Planning Meeting should answer the following two questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What will be delivered in the increment at the end of this sprint?
	\item	How will the work needed to deliver the increment be
	achieved?\cite{scrumguide11}
\end{itemize}
