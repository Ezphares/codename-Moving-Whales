\subsubsection{Sprint Planning Meeting}


The work of a sprint is determined at the Sprint Planning Meeting. The entire Scrum Team is gathered at this meeting and the meeting is time boxed to 8 hours for a 1 month sprint. If a sprint is shorter than 1 month, the meeting does not have to take 8 hours\cite{scrumguide11}. 


The actual time box of this meeting can then decrease proportionally with the amount of time scheduled for a sprint. For example, if a sprint takes 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks (a month), the meeting should take 4, instead of 8 hours\cite{scrumguide11}.  The Sprint Planning Meeting consists of two parts each time boxed to last half of the total time boxed duration for the Sprint Planning Meeting. In the event of an 8 hour meeting, each part would take 4 hours\cite{scrumguide11}.


The Sprint Planning Meeting should answer the following two questions\cite{scrumguide11}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What will be delivered in the increment at the end of this sprint?
	\item	How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?
\end{itemize}
