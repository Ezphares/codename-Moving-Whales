\subsubsection{Adaption}


If an inspector determines that the process deviates outside acceptable limits, it is important to adapt and adjust the material being processed to avoid further deviation\cite{scrumguide11}. Failing to do so can in worst case make the resulting product totally unacceptable\cite{scrumguide11}.
There are several ways that an inspection and an adjustment can be made, during any of these activities will ensure a smooth transition:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sprint planning meeting
	\item	Daily scrum
	\item	Sprint review
	\item	Sprint retrospective
\end{itemize}
