\subsubsection{Adaption}

If an inspector determines that a given process deviates outside acceptable limits, it is
important to adapt and adjust the material being processed to avoid further
deviation. Failing to do so can in worst case make the resulting product
totally unacceptable\cite{scrumguide11}.

There are several ways that an inspection and an adjustment can be made. During
any of these activities an adjustment will ensure a smooth transition:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sprint planning meeting
	\item	Daily scrum
	\item	Sprint review
	\item	Sprint retrospective
\end{itemize}
