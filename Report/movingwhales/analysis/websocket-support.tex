\subsection{WebSocket support}


A web socket consists of two parts.
The first part is a protocol that is currently under a standardization procedure by the organization IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) who cooperate closely with W3C\cite{andersen10}. The second part is a JavaScript-API that is used on the browser side\cite{andersen10}. Because web sockets are new, not all browsers support them, and not all browsers support the same Web Socket draft\cite{websocketprotocol11}. For Firefox and Opera Web Socket compatibility is disabled by default\cite{websocketprotocol11} and Internet Explorer supports draft 10 and not the newest, draft 17, which is in writing only supported by Google Chrome\cite{websocketprotocol11}.
