\subsection{WebSocket Support}

The WebSocket standard consists of two parts.
The first part is a protocol that is currently under a standardization 
procedure by the organization IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) who 
cooperate closely with W3C. The second part is a 
JavaScript-API that is used on the browser side\cite{andersen10}. 
Because WebSockets are new, not all browsers support them, and not all 
browsers support the same WebSocket draft\cite{websocketprotocol11}.  For Opera WebSocket compatibility is disabled by 
default\cite{websocketprotocol11}, IE10 will supports WebSocket when released (Developer Preview supports hybi-10) and rfc-6455 is only supported by 
Google Chrome 16\cite{websocketecho}.
