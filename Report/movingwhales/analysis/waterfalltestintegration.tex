\subsubsection{Verification and Integration}

The units of code received from the previous phase will be assembled here into a whole 
system. Each unit will then be tested for its functionality when assembled with the rest of 
the program to ensure that it works as intended. The programming 
that will happen here is bug fixing. The result of this phase is a 
working product that can be given to the customer\cite{waterfallexplained}.
