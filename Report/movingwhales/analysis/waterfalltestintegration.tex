\subsubsection{Testing and integration}


The units of code received from the previous phase will be assembled here into a whole system. Each unit will then be tested for its functionality when assembled with the rest of the program to ensure that it works as intended\cite{waterfallexplained}. The programming that will happen here is bug fixing\cite{waterfallexplained}. The result of this phase is a working product that can be given to the customer\cite{waterfallexplained}.
