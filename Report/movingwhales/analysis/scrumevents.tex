\subsection{Processes of Scrum}

The processes of Scrum are known as Scrum events\cite{scrumguide11}. 
A Scrum event is a meeting that takes place wherein the agenda and a time box 
is predetermined by the Scrum framework. 
The idea is that the events that Scrum makes use of, should cover all aspects 
of the Product Development ridding the need for extra meetings that the Team 
could arrange. What Scrum hopes to achieve with a time box 
is that the time spent planning or attending a meeting is kept efficient and 
to the point\cite{scrumguide11}.
