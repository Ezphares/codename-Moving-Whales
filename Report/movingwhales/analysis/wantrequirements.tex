\subsubsection{Want}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to use 
	\item Joining libraries (with other people in a session)
	\item Manage playlists
	\item Weighted search
	\item Drag and drop functionality for the GUI
\end{itemize}


These requirements are less important than the ``need'' list in terms of
priority, but more important than the ``nice'' list.
