\subsubsection{Want}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to use 
	\item Joining libraries (with other people in a session)
	\item Manage playlists
	\item Weighted search
	\item Drag and drop functionality for the GUI
\end{itemize}


The requirements in the want section are requirements that are more geared toward both creating a better user experience, but also to make the program feel much more complete. It is not necessary for the program to be complete that these features are implemented, but it would make the first-release of the program a lot better. The want list is more important for the program, than the nice-list in terms of priority. The want list is less important than the need list, however.
