\subsubsection{Transparency}


Transparency is a generally defined term. Transparency implies openness, communication and accountability. In Scrum it is to ensure that significant aspects of the process are visible to the person in control of the outcome\cite{scrumguide11}. Transparency is used to ensure that there is a common standard of communication so observers understand what they see\cite{scrumguide11}.

To give an example of transparency in Scrum:


\begin{itemize}
	\item A common definition of \textit{done} must be shared by those performing work and those accepting the final product\cite{scrumguide11}.
\end{itemize}
