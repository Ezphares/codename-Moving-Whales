\subsubsection{Transparency}


Transparency is a generally defined term. Transparency implies openness, communication and
accountability. In Scrum it is to ensure that the very significant aspects of the process 
are visible to those in control of the outcome\cite{scrumguide11}. Transparency is used 
to ensure that there is a shared common standard of communication so observers understand 
what they see\cite{scrumguide11}.

To give an example of transparency in Scrum:


\begin{itemize}
	\item A common understanding of \textit{done} must be shared by those doing the work and 
those receiving the end product\cite{scrumguide11}.
\end{itemize}
