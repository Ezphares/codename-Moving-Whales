\subsection{Polling}

When polling is being used, it 'bombards' the server in a sense with a lot of 
HTTP request packages each checking if the server has new data available, if 
the server has no new data ready for the browser, then the connection 
terminates - but restarts again after a set interval\cite{lubbersgreco}. 
Polling is good when you know when you know about the data that is typically 
being exchanged\cite{lubbersgreco} - basically, when you know at around which 
interval new data should be ready. If on the other hand you are not certain 
when new data is ready polling will inevitably make a lot of unnecessary 
requests to the server\cite{lubbersgreco}. Every time new data is available 
during a poll, the data is transferred from the server to the client after 
which the connection terminates and restarts\cite{lubbersgreco}.
