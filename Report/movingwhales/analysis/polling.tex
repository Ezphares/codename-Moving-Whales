\subsection{Polling}

When polling is being used, it ``bombards'' the server with a lot of 
HTTP request packages, each checking if the server has new data available, if 
the server has no new data ready for the browser, then the connection 
terminates - but restarts again after a set interval. 
Polling is good when you know at which interval the data is typically 
being updated - basically, when you know when new data should be ready. If on the other hand you are not certain 
when new data is ready polling will inevitably make a lot of unnecessary 
requests to the server. Every time new data is available 
during a poll, the data is transferred from the server to the client after 
which the connection terminates and restarts.\cite{lubbersgreco}
