\section{HTML5}
HTML5 is the newest revision of the HTML standard by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). It is still a draft, and has been a work in progress since 2004, when research of contemporary implementations of HTML was started. 34\% of the 100 most popular websites already implement HTML5\cite{Maine11}, even though W3C states, that HTML5 will not become the standard until 2014.\cite{W3C11} This might, in part, be due to HTML5's ability to run on devices like tablets and smartphones, but also the fact that HTML5 offers APIs - something that Facebook has offered since the 20th of October 2011 \cite{Kelly11} - which allows people to rapidly create web applications. It has also made the DOM, an HTML4 afterthought, a fundamental part of the specification, 

HTML5 differs from its predecessors(like HTML4, the W3C Recommendation from 1997 \cite{Kesteren11}) in various areas. The HTML5 standard tries to implement many of the features that people used to have to resort to other languages to obtain. An example is the native drag and drop, a feature that, as the name implies, allows the user to drag an element and drop it elsewhere and thus trigger events on the webpage. This feature is native in HTML5, and is available on all objects simply by setting the ``draggable'' attribute to true. It has also implemented a new, native, custom attribute called ``data'', consisting of an attribute name prefixed with ``data-'', and an attribute value, which is given as a string. This allows embedding of custom data-attributes inside a given HTML element, which makes JavaScript simpler.\cite{Bewick10}. 

HTML5 seeks to support all the modern multimedia options, and has the new <video> and <audio> tags to help make multimedia easily implemented on the webpage. Another noteworthy new element is the <canvas> element, which allows the developer to script dynamic 2D graphics, useful for e.g. web games. 
It also supports scalable vector graphics (SVG), a specification used to preserve the quality of graphics when scaling them up and down.

The native drag and drop is very useful for uploads of files, seeing as the dragging and dropping of files is intuitive, even to new users. It allows for an interface without an upload button and thus frees up space for other uses. Drag and drop in a music player is also convenient when creating a playlist, or playing a song. Dragging the song to the list or onto the music player makes sense, seeing as the interaction is easily understood.
