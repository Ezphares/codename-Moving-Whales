\subsection{Our usage of Scrum}


Though the Scrum framework states that a version of Scrum that does not employ every process is not in fact Scrum, we have for this project used Scrum as much as it made sense for us - even if the end result cannot be labeled as achieved through Scrum\cite{scrumguide11}. The group made use of the Sprint process throughout the entirety of the project - but omitted the Daily Scrum for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A varying course schedule made it difficult to arrange a time and place to meet up every day.
	\item Due to the difference in programming ability between group members, it did not prove very useful to keep the meeting (asking for help and stating obstacles was simply easier via e-mails)
	\item Group members were not working on the project at the same time due to courses.
\end{itemize}

The group did not make use of a Product Owner though it was debated letting the project's supervisor become the Product Owner. We decided in the group that it was better to merge the roles a little bit, and give the Scrum Master the Product Backlog management job.
