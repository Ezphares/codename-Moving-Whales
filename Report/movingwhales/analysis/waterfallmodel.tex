\subsection{Waterfall Model}


The waterfall model is another kind of development process. Unlike Scrum, the waterfall model is not an iterative process.  The waterfall model is made up of a series of process-steps. These steps are Requirement specification, Software design, Implementation, Testing and maintenance. When one phase is finished, another should begin - hence the name Waterfall. Using the waterfall model, the developers can never go back up the process-tree - they have to follow the phase-pattern downward\cite{waterfallexplained}.
