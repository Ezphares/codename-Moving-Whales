\subsection{Functional and non-functional requirements}

Functional requirements are requirements of the system's functionality and behaviour. For instance, if it is a necessity for the system to function properly, that a high level of security is added and all communication between the client and server makes use of an encryption protocol, then that would be a functional requirement\cite{SEF01}.
The functional requirements of the program are all geared toward a finished first-release of the program. The group has prioritized getting the system up and running very high which can be shown in the need-want-nice list later in this section. 
The non-functional requirements are requirements that represent how the operation of the system has to be. 
As a general rule of thumb to describe the difference between the two: functional requirements are usually in the form of: "The system shall do <requirement>" and non-functional requirements are of the form: "system shall be <requirement>". So, a non functional requirement would be of the form: "how well should the program be encrypted".

With this in mind, the group created a need-want-nice list to specify the absolute necessary requirements, and the requirements to the program that were less necessary. A need-want-nice list helps illustrate and set into boxes what the actual requirements to the program are.
