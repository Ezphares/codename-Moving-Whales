\subsection{Functional and non-functional requirements}

Functional requirements are requirements of the system's functionality and behaviour. For instance, if it is a necessity for a given system to function properly, that a high level of security is added and all communication between the client and server makes use of an encryption protocol, then that would be a functional requirement\cite{SEF01}.

The non-functional requirements are requirements that represent how the operation of the system has to be. 
As a rule of thumb, to describe the difference between the two: functional requirements are usually in the form of: "The system shall do <requirement>" and non-functional requirements are of the form: "system shall be <requirement>". So, a non functional requirement to the above example would be of the form: "how well should the program be encrypted".

With this in mind, the group created a need-want-nice list to specify the absolute necessary requirements, and the requirements to the program that were less necessary. A need-want-nice list helps illustrate and set into boxes what the actual requirements to the program are and how they are prioritized.
