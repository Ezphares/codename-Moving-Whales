\subsection{WebSocket efficiency}


In a standard HTTP connection, there is a lot of overhead\cite{lubbersgreco}. 
What the web socket does very well is stripping redundant data from the data 
that is actually relevant, which there is a lot of, when a polling solution is 
used to keep a website updated in real-time\cite{lubbersgreco}. 

Looking at the latency, if a server takes 50ms to send a message to the 
browser, the polling application would introduce extra latency because the 
connection would terminate, only to restart (taking another 50ms) - which 
during this time of re-establishing a connection means that the server cannot 
contact the browser with new data\cite{lubbersgreco}. The web socket never 
breaks communication with the server once opened - unless specified otherwise, 
and allows the server to send new data immediately as it receives 
it\cite{lubbersgreco}. Obviously it would still take 50ms for the server to 
send data to the browser via the web socket - but the real gain here is that 
the web socket will not have to send a request to the server to re-establish 
connection after it receives a message, like when polling is 
used\cite{lubbersgreco}.
