\subsection{WebSocket Efficiency}

In a standard HTTP connection, there is a lot of overhead. 
What the web socket does very well is separating redundant data from the data 
that is actually relevant. There is quite a lot of redundancy when a polling solution is 
used to keep a website updated in real-time. 

Looking at the latency, if a server sends a message to the 
browser, the polling application would introduce additional delay because the 
connection would terminate, only to restart and
during this time of establishing a new connection, the server cannot 
contact the browser with new data. The WebSocket never 
breaks communication with the server once opened - unless instructed otherwise, 
and allows the server to send new data immediately as it becomes available. The real gain is that 
the WebSocket client will not have to send a request to the server to establish a new 
connection after it receives a message, like when polling is 
used.\cite{lubbersgreco}
