\subsubsection{Scrum theory}

Scrum was founded on the basis of empirical process control theory\cite{scrumguide11}.

Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes primairily via experience and basing 
decisions on evidence or what is known. Scrum uses the three pillars of 
empiricism: Transparency, inspection and adaption\cite{scrumguide11}.
