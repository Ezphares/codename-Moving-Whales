\subsubsection{Scrum theory}


Scrum was founded on the basis of empirical control theory\cite{scrumguide11}. Empiricism
asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is
known\cite{scrumguide11}. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize
predictability and control risk\cite{scrumguide11}. Scrum uses the three pillars of
empiricism, transparency, inspection and adaption\cite{scrumguide11}.
