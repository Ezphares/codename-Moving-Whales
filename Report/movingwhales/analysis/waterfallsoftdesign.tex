\subsubsection{Software design}

This phase is not a phase used for actual programming. It is here the system is designed, to 
get an overview of what it would look like. The requirement 
specification is studied to help specifying hardware requirements, system requirements and 
overall system architecture.  The results of this phase are 
software design documents that can be used in the next phase\cite{waterfallexplained}.
