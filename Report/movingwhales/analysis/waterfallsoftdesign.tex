\subsubsection{Software design}


This phase is not a phase used for actual programming. It is here the system is designed, to get an overview of what it would look like\cite{waterfallexplained}. The requirement specification is studied to help specifying hardware requirements, system requirements and overall system architecture\cite{waterfallexplained}.  The results of this phase are software design documents that can be used in the next phase\cite{waterfallexplained}.
