\subsubsection{Server requirements}

The server in the system should validate client data. It should also be the
direct communicator to the database. The functionalities of the server should 
therefore be to handle whatever requests the client has, in a suitable manner 
and of course to serve the application to the client. The server also acts as
security layer to the system.
