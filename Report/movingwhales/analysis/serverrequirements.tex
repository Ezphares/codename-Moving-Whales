\subsubsection{Server requirements}


The server in the system should validate client data. It should also be the
direct-communicator to the database, which is something the client should not do. The
functionalities of the server should therefore be to handle whatever requests the client
has, in a suitable manner and of course to serve the program to the client. The server acts
as security layer to the program.
