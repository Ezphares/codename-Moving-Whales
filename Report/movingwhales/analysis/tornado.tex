\section{Choice of web server}
Tornado\cite{tornadoweb11} is a Python-based web server. 
%TODO: NOPE! chuck testa - det er et web server FRAMEWORK. difference :)
It is practical to have the webserver in the same language as the web framework 
for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is that it allows the 
websocket implementation to directly use Django's ORM to access the database, 
for example to authenticate users. Had the websocket server been based on 
another language, it would in essence be necessary to do everything twice for 
the database. 
%TODO: for the database - omformuleres
It also has the advantage that any modules written for Django is 
usable in Tornado and vice versa.
%TODO: JA! :D  bortset fra at det ikke er vice versa, men væk med det, så er 
%alt godt! :D
