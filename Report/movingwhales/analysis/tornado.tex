\section{Choice of web server}
Tornado\cite{tornadoweb11} is a Python-based web server. It is practical to have the webserver in the same language as the web framework for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is that it allows the websocket implementation to directly use Django's ORM to access the database, for example to authenticate users. Had the websocket server been based on another language, it would in essence be necessary to do everything twice for the database. It also has the advantage that any modules written for Django is usable in Tornado and vice versa.
