\subsubsection{The Sprint Retrospective}


The Sprint Retrospective Meeting is a meeting that is time boxed for a 3 hour duration on a 1 month sprint. The Sprint Retrospective starts after the Sprint Review Meeting.
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective Meeting is to allow the Scrum Team to look inward and inspect itself to find potential changes that would be beneficial to enact during the upcoming sprint\cite{scrumguide11}. The meeting seeks to inspect the following:\cite{scrumguide11}

\begin{itemize}
	\item	How the last sprint went in regards to people, tools and processes. 
	\item Identity and order items that went well during the sprint.
	\item	Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team works.
\end{itemize}


The result of the Sprint Retrospective Meeting is a formal identification of improvements for the next sprint\cite{scrumguide11}. The Scrum Team does not have to use the Sprint Retrospective Meeting to find and adapt to new improvements - the meeting simply gives the Team a chance to sit down and inspect things for the better\cite{scrumguide11}.
