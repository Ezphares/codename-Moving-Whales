\subsection{JavaScript}
JavaScript, originally known as ECMAScript, is an object-oriented scripting language for web-development used to generate dynamic content on webpages. All major webbrowsers support JavaScript, and as it is the only scripting language all browsers support it is considered \textbf{the} scripting language of the internet. JavaScript that runs client-side allows for fast response to keypresses, mouseclicks and other user actions. JavaScript also offers extensive handling of non-user activated events. 

The most popular JavaScript library is jQuery, a library that, in compliance with their slogan, ``write less, do more.'', allows for simpler writing of the client-side scripts. It is currently used by 41.4\% of all websites monitored by W3Techs \cite{W3Tech11} and is very useful for projects in need of fast developing, like a university project.

SoundManager 2 is a library which, as the name implies, lets the developer manage, create and play sounds on the webpage via a hidden Flash video. It consists of two files: and API and the Flash 8 movie, but does not require the developer to maintain any Flash code. \cite{Schiller07}
