%JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language
JavaScript is a prototype-oriented scripting language usually used for
web-development. All major webbrowsers support JavaScript, and as it is the only
scripting language all major browsers support it is considered \textbf{the}
scripting language of the internet. 
JavasScript allows scripting of webpage events like keypresses and mouseclicks.
Since JavaScript has access to the DOM, it allows document manipulation,
providing users with an almost seamless interaction with the webpage.

%TODO extensive handing? non-user activated events? really? source?
%JavaScript also offers extensive handling of non-user activated events.
The most popular JavaScript library is jQuery, 
a library that, in compliance with their slogan, ``write less, do more.'', 
allows for faster scripting. It is currently used by 41.4\% of all
websites monitored by W3Techs \cite{W3Tech11} and is very useful for projects
needing rapid prototyping.

SoundManager 2 is a library which, as the name implies, lets the developer
manage and play sounds on webpages via a hidden Flash object. It consists of two
files: a JavaScript API and a Flash movie file. By providing a
JavaScript API to the functionality of the Flash file, developers don't need to
maintain any ActionScript (The scripting language Flash uses).
