\subsection{JavaScript}

JavaScript is a prototype-oriented scripting language usually used for
web-development. All major webbrowsers support JavaScript, and as it is the only
scripting language all major browsers support it is considered \textbf{the}
scripting language of the internet. 
JavaScript allows scripting of webpage events like keypresses and mouseclicks.
Since JavaScript has access to the DOM, it allows document manipulation, providing dynamic content to webpages.
