\subsubsection{Database requirements}


The database's functionalities should be geared towards the storing of data. Through the server the data that represents a client or other data a client needs, can be retrieved. But this should never occur directly from the client to the database, the server would have to be the middle-layer. The database should also be in charge of handling the music library a client creates in a suitable fashion.
