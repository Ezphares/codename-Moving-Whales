\subsubsection{Client requirements}
A user may access the create profile functionality of the program which sets up a user-profile for the system. The user can insert the most commonly used data into the boxes available to them on the register screen. These fields should include, but not be limited to: username, password and e-mail. There should also be fields in the register menu that are more geared toward the social networking aspect of the program - such as biography, country and date of birth. 
A user must also be able to edit their profile at any given time. A user will be able to change whatever information tied to their profile they require - so long as it is not their username. 

A user must be able to manage their music library and play music from their library. The music library should be the most important aspect of the music management program, because it is here the user will actually be able to use the main functionality of the program - to play music and establish their online library. It should also be possible for a user to create a playlist of songs and manage it in any way they would seem reasonable. Playlists should be sortable with the traditional orderings (e.g. album, artist and alphabetical title sort). The user should also be able to create his own sorting types - for example if the user wishes their playlist to start out playing the quiet songs in their playlist, and end with louder songs, or something else, then those sortings should be savable.

The program should also support a social aspect which gives a user access to a forum where they may discuss music as well manage their friend-lists. As part of the functionality, Movingwhales should allow users to join up in sessions and listen to the same song simultaneously with other users and create playlists that they can run through. A session should have a person that is the DJ of the music session. A DJ is the administrator of the session and has the rights to manipulate the playlist or kicking and inviting people from a session. A session should also have a vote system that allows users to democratically choose to skip to next song, hop back to the previous song, restart the song currently playing or even changing the DJ and other such functionality that might be relevant.
