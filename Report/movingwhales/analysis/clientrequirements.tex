\subsubsection{Client requirements}
A user may access the create profile functionality of the program which sets up a user-profile for the system. The user can insert the most commonly used data into the boxes available to them on the register screen. These fields should include, but not be limited to: username, password and e-mail. There should also be fields in the register menu that are more geared toward the social networking aspect of the program - such as biography, country and date of birth. 
A user must also be able to edit their profile at any given time. A user will be able to change whatever information tied to their profile they require - so long as it is not their username. 

A user must be able to manage their music library and play music from their library. The music library should be the most important aspect of the music management program, because it is here the user will actually be able to use the main functionality of the program - to play music and establish their online library.

The program should also support a social aspect which gives a user access to a forum where they may discuss music as well manage their friend-lists. As part of the functionality, Movingwhales should allow users to join up in sessions and listen to the same song simultaneously with other users.
