\subsection{The Sprint}

The sprint is the key event of Scrum. 
A sprint is a container for all other events.
A sprint can be time boxed from anywhere between a few weeks, to as far as a month. 
There is no restriction as to how 
long a sprint is kept, but a sprint's upper limit is a single calendar 
month\cite{scrumguide11}. The most important thing to note however is that 
when a sprint time box has been arranged, it will be kept throughout the 
entire product development period\cite{scrumguide11}. This means that a 
first sprint cannot last 2 weeks, and the second 6 weeks. There has to be 
consistency in the time box used\cite{scrumguide11}. When a sprint has 
finished, a new one starts immediately afterwards\cite{scrumguide11}.


A sprint consists of 5 aspects, the Sprint Planning Meeting, Daily Scrums, 
development work, Sprint Review and the Sprint Retrospective\cite{scrumguide11}. 


When a sprint has begun it is important that no changes are made that would 
affect the Sprint Goal\cite{scrumguide11}. The Development Team composition 
remains fixed. Quality goals (non-functional requirements) do not 
decrease\cite{scrumguide11}. The scope may be clarified however during a sprint and 
re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is 
learned\cite{scrumguide11}. 


A sprint may be canceled at any time during the Product Owner, if the current 
Sprint Goals are no longer relevant for the entirety of the product - for 
example, if the buyer simply wishes to go totally different ways with their 
product by excluding a feature currently being worked on\cite{scrumguide11}. 
This means that though during a sprint goals and aspirations cannot change - 
the entire sprint CAN be canceled at request of the Product 
Owner\cite{scrumguide11}. When a sprint is canceled, a new sprint has to be 
set up\cite{scrumguide11}.
