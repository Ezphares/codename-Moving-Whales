\subsubsection{Daily Scrum}


A Daily Scrum is a meeting time boxed to last 15 minutes, wherein each member in the
Development Team shares information about their work progress, as well as their work-plan
until the next Daily Scrum\cite{scrumguide11}. The daily Scrum should be held at the same
time and same place for the sake of reducing complexity\cite{scrumguide11}.  The most common
and important questions to have answered during this meeting are\cite{scrumguide11}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What has been accomplished since last meeting?
	\item What will be done for the next meeting?
	\item What obstacles are in the way?
\end{itemize}


The point of the Daily Scrum is to ensure that progress is going forward, and no person in
the Development Team is stuck\cite{scrumguide11}. The Daily Scrum meeting helps improve
communication between the members in the Development Team, but it is important to stress
that it should only be a meeting for the Development Team\cite{scrumguide11}. This means
that during the meeting, the Product Owner should not be present, and neither should the
Scrum Master. The Scrum Master can be there, but only to enforce the 15 minute time box -
otherwise it is up to the Development Team to follow the rules\cite{scrumguide11}. 


After the Daily Scrum, the Development Team can meet up for an extended meeting where they
figure out if they can reach the Sprint Goals or not\cite{scrumguide11}. If necessary, the
goals can be renegotiated\cite{scrumguide11}.
