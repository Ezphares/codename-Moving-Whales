The browser sends a complete request, but the server maintains an open response that is kept continually updated\cite{lubbersgreco}. The connection can either be kept open permanently or temporarily - there are no requirements one way or the other\cite{lubbersgreco}. The server updates the response every time there is data ready to be sent to the client\cite{lubbersgreco}. The server however, does not close off the connection after data has been sent\cite{lubbersgreco}. Other parameters have to be met here before that happens\cite{lubbersgreco}.
