\subsection{Advantages}

The advantages of the lose coupling in the MVC design pattern is that it makes it possible for 
multiple developers to work on different aspects of the application simultaneously. 
Furthermore, since the model is dependant on neither the view nor the controller, the model 
can be created and tested separately\cite{modelviewcontroller}.

Since the model is independant from the views it follows that a user interface can display data from multiple 
views simultaneously. Another advantage is that on a webpage where the user is able to change, for example, the 
color scheme, the shared model remains the same, but the way it is displayed does not - though the data is 
essentially the same\cite{modelviewcontroller}.
