\subsection{Advantages}


The advantages of the lose coupling in the MVC design pattern is that make it possible for multiple developers to work on different aspects of the application simultaneously. Furthermore, since the model is dependant on neither the view nor the controller, the model can be created and tested independently\cite{modelviewcontroller}.


Because of the model's independence, a user interface can show multiple views of the same data at the same time\cite{modelviewcontroller}. Another example is a web application that allows the user to change the appearance of the page. These pages show the same data from a shared model, but presented in a different way\cite{modelviewcontroller}.
