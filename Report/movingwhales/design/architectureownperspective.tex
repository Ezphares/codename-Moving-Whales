\subsection{Our own perspective}

Given that the group has decided that scalability is a 'very important' non-functional 
requirement, making clever use of client-server architecture is a must for a final product. 
How it will be done in practice, is something to be considered for future work - given the 
scope of the program. 


The group recognizes that 2-Tier architecture would not be sufficient for this type of 
application. The program should be accessible through a browser, which means that the client 
should not have to install a program on their own machine to use our system. This also means 
that when the architecture is created, this should be kept in mind. A thin client is a 
client that does not need to process data locally - the processing should be on the server 
side\cite{thinclients08}. The servers will therefore be responsible for adding security 
layers to the system as mentioned in the 3-Tier architecture - but just as well the 
essential processing of the program.
