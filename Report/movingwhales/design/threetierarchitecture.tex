\subsection{3-Tier Architecture}

3-tier architecture is slightly more advanced. The division of labour here is not 'simply' 
client / server. There is an extra layer - and for the sake of example this layer is a 
database server. This gives us the three layers of client, application server and database 
server. 


When the client requests data from the server, the server calls the database server, which 
sends an SQL query to the database to find this data. The database server then sends the 
fetched data to the application server, before sending it to the client in a response. This 
means that the client is linked to one server, and the server is linked to another server, 
which in turn is linked to a database\cite{tierserverclient08}.
