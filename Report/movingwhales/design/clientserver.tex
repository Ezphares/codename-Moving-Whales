\section{Client-Server Architecture}

The following section contains basic information about client-server architecture. At the 
end of the section, the group's own perspective will be shared along with the thoughts the 
group had in terms of this topic.

The client-server architecture is used as a way to distribute a system to other processors
which can be geographically spread\cite{ooad01}. An example of a client-server system is the 
credit card verification system implemented into each of a bank's terminals. This system 
verifies the credit card's authenticity with a centrally located server - in this case, each 
of a bank's terminals would be a client, and the central verification, would be the 
server\cite{ooad01}.

Illustrated, the client-server architecture looks as follows:

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

The diagram is quite simplified and is by no means meant to illustrate an actual network. It
illustrates six clients: various forms of computers and some handheld devices all connected
to one, central server.


The purpose of the server is to offer to the clients whatever is general / common for each
client. This could be a common database, mail access, or some kind of printer  
functionality\cite{ooad01}. Basically, there are no restrictions. 


Client-server architecture can be more advanced than simply a client establishing a
connection to a server\cite{tierserverclient08}. These levels of advancement are called 
'tiers'\cite{tierserverclient08}. Tiers are the division of labour for various computer 
functions in a system.
