\subsection{Tier 2 and 3 compared}

The main thing to consider when comparing these two Tiers is what characterizes them. Tier 2 
is obviously more versatile - it can handle all the requests it gets from the client without 
needing another layer\cite{tierserverclient08}. Tier 3 is less versatile, and much more 
specialized. The raw advantages of using Tier 3 architecture, is the added security a server 
offers to a system [2]. The added security is there because each part in the Tier can define 
its own security measures\cite{tierserverclient08}. Multiple Tiers offer better performance 
as well because tasks can be shared between the servers in the 
architecture\cite{tierserverclient08}.
