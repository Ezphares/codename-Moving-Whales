\subsection{Tier 2 and 3 Compared}

The main thing to consider when comparing these two tiers is what characterizes them. Tier 2 
is obviously more versatile - it can handle all the requests it gets from the client without 
needing another layer. Tier 3 is less versatile, and much more 
specialized. The raw advantages of using tier 3 in the architecture, is the added security a server 
offers to a system. The added security is there because each part in the tier can define 
its own security measures. Multiple tiers offer better performance 
as well because tasks can be shared between the servers in the 
architecture\cite{tierserverclient08}.
