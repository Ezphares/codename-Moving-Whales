The database diagram has been made as it has because the group has not had any course or theory about databases, so it is mostly made by intuition. As mentioned earlier in this report, Django uses an ORM so constructing the database has not been of the groups concerns. Even though Django took care the most of making the the database, the group still had to choose which attributes would be needed to fulfil the projects requirements. Though one of the tables is implemented by Django, that would be the User table.
