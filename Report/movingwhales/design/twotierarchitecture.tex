\subsection{2-Tier Architecture}

2-tier architecture is quite simple. When a client has established a connection to a server, 
and begins to request resources, the server serves these in a response to the client. The 2-tier 
architecture does not make use of another application, because 
the server has access right away without needing an extra layer to give 
the client the resources requested\cite{tierserverclient08}.
