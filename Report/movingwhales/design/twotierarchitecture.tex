\subsection{2-Tier Architecture}

2-tier architecture is quite simple. When a client has established connection to a server, 
and begins to request resources from the server. The server potentially sends an SQL query 
to the database before it gives these resources in a response back to the client. The 2-tier 
architecture does not make use of another application. This is 2-tier architecture, because 
the server has access to these resources right away without needing an extra layer to give 
the client the resources it requests\cite{tierserverclient08}.
