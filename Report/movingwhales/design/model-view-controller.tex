\section{Model-viewer-controller}


Model-view-controller is a design pattern used by developers\cite{mvcasp}. The model-view-controller is most commonly used when working on web-applications\cite{mvcasp}. The idea of using the model-view-controller is to - for example, separate the UI from the part of the program that stores the data\cite{modelviewcontroller}. 

The reason why this is a very efficient approach, is that a UI changes a lot more often, than the business logic\cite{modelviewcontroller}. The MVC-pattern makes it easier to change the modules\cite{modelviewcontroller}.


The model-view-controller image was found on\cite{modelviewcontroller} and looks as follows:
