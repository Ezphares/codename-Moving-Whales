\section{Model-View-Controller}

Model-view-controller is a design pattern used by developers. The 
model-view-controller is most commonly used when working on web-applications\cite{mvcasp}. 
The idea of using the model-view-controller is to separate the UI from the 
part of the program that stores the data\cite{modelviewcontroller}. 

The reason why this is a very efficient approach, is that a UI changes a lot more often, 
than the business logic. The MVC-pattern makes it easier to change 
models, views and controllers individually\cite{modelviewcontroller}.

The model-view-controller image looks as follows:
