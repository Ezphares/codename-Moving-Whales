\section{Libraries in JavaScript}
The most popular JavaScript library is jQuery\cite{jquery11}, 
a library that, in compliance with their slogan, ``write less, do more.'', 
allows for faster scripting. It is currently used by 41.4\% of all
websites monitored by W3Techs \cite{W3Tech11} and is very useful for projects
needing rapid prototyping. Almost all of the JavaScript in the project uses the jQuery library.

SoundManager 2\cite{Schiller07} is a library which, as the name implies, lets the developer
manage and play sounds on webpages via a hidden Flash object. It consists of two
files: a JavaScript API and a Flash movie file. By providing a
JavaScript API to the functionality of the Flash file, developers don't need to
maintain any ActionScript (The scripting language Flash uses). 
This is the library used to play music on the webpage.
