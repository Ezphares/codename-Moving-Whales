\subsection{Cooperative evaluation}
Cooperative evaluation relies on the participants to work as co-evaluators, seeing as they get to comment on the interface based on tasks given by the designers. This is the chosen method of testing, and below is a table showing guidelines for a cooperative evaluation:

\input{test/figures/coop_table}
Sample questions \textsl{during} evaluation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What do you want to do?
	\item What were you expecting to happen?
	\item What is the system telling you?
	\item Why has the system done that?
	\item What are you doing now?
\end{itemize}

Sample questions \textsl{after} the session:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What was the best/worst thing about the prototype?
	\item What most needs changing?
	\item How easy were the tasks?
	\item How realistic were the tasks?
	\item Did giving a commentary distract you?
\end{itemize}\cite{Benyon10}
