\subsection{Co-discovery}
Co-discovery works by letting people interact with the technology and commenting or thinking aloud, or putting participants together in pairs, preferably people who know each other well, and letting the play around with the technology. This will often lead to new ways of interaction that would not be discoverd had the participants been isolated. This method is good for getting first impressions, but is not what was chosen in this project.
