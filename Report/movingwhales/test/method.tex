\section{Method of Testing}
There are several methods of testing the design of an interface, some involving experts and designers and some involving ``real'' people. Participant-based evaluation involves the ``real'' people, and it is what we chose to do with this project, seeing as we appreciate the user's views on our design decisions. There are several ways to conduct a participant-based evaluation: Cooperative evaluation, participatory heuristic evaluation, co-discovery and controlled experiments. A short description will be given of each type of participant-based testing, and the chosen method will be described in greater detail.
All methods are from ``Designing Interactive Systems''\cite{Benyon10}
