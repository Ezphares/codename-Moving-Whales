\chapter{Testing}

In this chapter the method used to test the user interface is described, how the test was conducted and the issues discovered through the testing. Testing is a crucial aspect of any software project, as it is through testing the bugs and issues are discovered that would be overlooked by people who have designed and coded the project. It allows the developers to look at the project with new eyes and see things the way a person completely new to the system would see it.
