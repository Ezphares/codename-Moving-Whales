\chapter{Testing}

In this chapter the method used to test the user interface is described, along with how the test was conducted and the issues discovered through the testing. Testing is a crucial aspect of any software project, as it is through testing the bugs and issues, which would be overlooked by the people who have designed and coded the project, are discovered. It allows the developers to look at the project with new eyes and see things the way a person completely new to the system would see it.
