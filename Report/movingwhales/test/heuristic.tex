\subsection{Participatory heuristic evaluation}
This method of testing involves the participants, alongside usability experts, as ``work-domain experts''. The same procedure as for the expert version is applied, and the participants are briefed about the requirements. An expert heuristic evaluation relies on human computer interaction (HCI) experts to perform the evaluation, based on the following design principles:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Visibility
	\item Consistency
	\item Familiarity
	\item Affordance
	\item Navigation
	\item Control
	\item Feedback
	\item Recovery
	\item Constraints
	\item Flexibility
	\item Style
	\item Conviviality
\end{enumerate}
As this is not the method chosen, heuristic evaluation will not be further explained.
