\subsection{Synthesis}
All three participants had largely the same problems with the interface, so below is a synthesised list of things that need changing to improve userfriendliness:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Date-format should be clearly stated when creating a profile to prevent confusion.
	\item Notification of new friend requests should be incorporated to show the user that they have pending requests.
	\item There should be an invite button for invitations to sessions.
	\item There should be enter-support for user input. 
	\item Upload should also have a button for uploading and the drop event should be caught and handled accordingly if the files are dropped in the wrong place.
	\item When trying to playback songs there should be support for doubleclicking the songs to play them.
\end{itemize}
